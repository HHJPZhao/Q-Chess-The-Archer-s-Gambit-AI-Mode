üéØ Object of the Game
The goal of Q Chess: The Archer's Gambit is to defeat the computer opponent by placing its General in checkmate. This is a game of traditional strategy, enhanced with the long-range threat of the new Archer piece.

1. Game Setup
The Board: The game is played on a standard 9x10 Chinese Chess board, which includes a "river" dividing the two sides and a 3x3 "palace" for each General.

The Pieces: The game uses a traditional Xiangqi set, with one key modification.

The Archers: On each side, two Soldiers (Pawns) are replaced by two Archers. The Archers start on the points next to the Cannons.

2. How to Play
Player Choice: At the start of a new game, you (the human player) can choose to play as Red (going first) or Black (going second). The AI will automatically take the opposite color.

Turns: Players take turns moving one of their pieces. Red always moves first.

Winning: The game is won when you make a move that places the opponent's General in "check," and they have no legal moves to escape the check. This is "checkmate."

ü§ñ The AI Opponent
In this mode, you will play against a computer-controlled opponent.

Behavior: The AI is designed to be a strategic player. It analyzes the board, evaluates potential moves, and attempts to choose the best possible action on its turn.

Rules: The AI follows all the same rules as the human player and has no unfair advantages. It must adhere to the legal movements of every piece.

‚ôüÔ∏è Piece Movement & Capture Rules
All pieces move along the lines of the board, occupying the intersections.
